Zoe Game Engine
===============

The Zoe Game Engine is an ongoing hobby project of mine.  I started developing
this in C using SDL several years ago.  I intend to return to that line of
development.  However, this project is now being done largely with Python
using [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/).

The purpose of this project is for me to learn some basic engine design, and
have a ready-made, high-performance graphics setup that can be used to quickly
implement simple games, 2D visualizations, and prototype UI systems.
